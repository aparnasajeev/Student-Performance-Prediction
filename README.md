## Student Performance Prediction Project

Overview: 
Welcome to the Student Performance Prediction project! This end-to-end machine learning project is designed to predict student performance. We've covered the entire process, from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to hyperparameter tuning for various models.

Project Structure: 
The project is organized in a modular structure to enhance readability and maintainability. 
The brief overview of the key components is as follws:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore and analyze the dataset to gain insights into student performance patterns.

Feature Engineering: Create relevant features to improve the predictive power of the models.

Model Development: Experiment with different machine learning models to predict student performance. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance.

Deployment: The project is set up for deployment using Flask, making it easy to deploy the model as a web service.4
